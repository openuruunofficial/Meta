# Usage of update.sh and ini
`ini` is a tool I made to manipulate ini files via shell. Place this in the same directory as `update.sh`.<br/>
`update.sh` is the script the cron job calls or to initialize the mirror. It contains a path value in the top of the script to set where the mirror is sent to.<br/>
Set a cron job to run nightly as any user and have it run `update.sh`.
